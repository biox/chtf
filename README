         `~* chtf *~`

  chtf is a simple shell script
  that manages terraform versions.

  i made it because the existing
  solutions were way too big for
  what i thought was a simple problem.


      ??? deps+install ???

  to install chtf, just put it anywhere in
  your $PATH. i put it in ~/bin personally.

  you'll need to install these deps:
    - curl
    - unzip

  you'll also need ~/bin in your $PATH near
  the beginning somewhere, since chtf relies
  on symlinking ~/bin/terraform to the proper
  version.

  most distros will have everything you need
  out of the box.


       !!! demo !!!

  here's a full demo of chtf's capabilities:

  # list versions (* represents active)

    $ chtf
    0.11.1
    0.12.1*

  # switch to a different installed version
    $ chtf 0.11.1
    $ chtf
    0.11.1*
    0.12.1
    $ terraform version
    Terraform v0.11.1

  # download a new version and make it active

    $ chtf 1.2.5
    terraform version not found
    downloading https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.2.5/terraform_1.2.5_linux_amd64.zip
    $ terraform version
